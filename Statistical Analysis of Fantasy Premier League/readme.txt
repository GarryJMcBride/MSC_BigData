*Notes on code
 
Change data set link at top for weeks 0 and weeks 7 by removing and replacing ‘#’. It doesn’t matter which graph week you use, as they both are the same, the only difference is the title of the graph says week 0 or 7.  
There is some code I haven’t used. Unsupervised method is in “Premier League Analysis Code” along with all graphs and diagrams. Supervised method has been sent in a separate file due to complications with packages.
